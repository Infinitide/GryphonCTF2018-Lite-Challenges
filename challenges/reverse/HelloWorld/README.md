# HelloWorld

## Question Text
I just learnt C#, so logically, I wrote a simple program to test it out
*Note that the program can only be run on Windows machines*

### Hint
De-compilation

*Creator - Chuan Kai (@exetr)*

## Setup Guide
1. Using Developer Command Prompt for VS 2017, run `csc Program.cs`

## Distribution
1. Distribute contents inside `distrib` folder

## Solution
1. Using a C# decompiler, optimally [JetBrains' dotPeek] (https://www.jetbrains.com/decompiler/), the code can be revealed easily
2. Alternatively, the user can paste the contents set by the program to reveal the flag
### Flag
