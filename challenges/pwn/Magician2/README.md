# Magician

## Question Text

I got inspired by PotatoDrug's magician show, so I made my own.

You may need 32 bit libraries for this on 64-bit machines! `apt-get install libc6-i386`

Or use whatever command you would to get the 32-bit libs...

`nc pwn.chal.gryphonctf.com 18156`

### Hints

1. How do I write to stack with format strings? 
2. Wonder what the whispering voice was about. Maybe I need to use magic to make it my own?

## Setup Guide

1. Build binaries: `make` in generate
    - Distributes binaries to distrib and service
2. Build docker image: `./build.sh` in service
3. Run docker image: `./run.sh` in service
