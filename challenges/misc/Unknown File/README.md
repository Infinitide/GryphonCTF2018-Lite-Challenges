## Solution
1. open with notepad and find out that the extension is .stl
2. append .stl to file
3. when opened with any stl viewer, user will find text "flag inside" and know they are on the right track (1.jpg)
4. recommended solution is to open in 3d builder and split(2.jpg) or hollow(3.jpg) to find flag or use an online stl viewer (4.jpg) and view wiremesh to find flag. If on linux, download meshlab with `sudo apt-get install meshlab`, then import mesh and view wireframe (5.jpg)

### Flag
