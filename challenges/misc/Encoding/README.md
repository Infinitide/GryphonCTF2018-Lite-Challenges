Distribute all the contents inside `distrib` folder to the users

## Solution
The first encoding to be decoded is base64, we'll then get a base32 encoded string, decode that we'll get a base16 encoded string, decode that we'll get a base8 encoded string, decode that and we'll get the flag.

**Flag:** GCTF{e1ght\_s1xt55n\_th1rtytw0\_s1xtyf0ur}
